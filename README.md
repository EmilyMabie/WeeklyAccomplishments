When you reach the top of a mountain, it can be hard to look back at where you started and realize just how hard you worked to ascend. To ensure I never lose sight of my progress, this is a running log of my weekly work accomplishments as I grow in my new role.


Week | Accomplishments
------------ | -------------
1 | Connected with Coding Dojo leadership staff to explore roles, responsibilities, and departmental needs. Exceeded first week accomplishment itinerary by executing 110% of expected output.
2 | Began work to align the curriculums of multiple courses into one unified offering. Restructured existing course material into a cohesive storyboard flow using backwards design. Created tools for self-assessment as well as instructor-directed feedback.

Initiated the construction of an eLearning unit based on the feedback of the stakeholder team.

Prepared a team of people for my absence by providing them the tools and the framework for completing must-do action items prior to my return.
